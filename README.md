Boom_Bike Case Study
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has a daily dataset on the rental bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. 
It wishes to use this data to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and 
come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown due to corona pandemic comes to an end.

The project uses Linear Regression Model to train and test the data set and predict the outcome.

The model uses 'cnt' as the target variable.

Model is evalauted in the basis of R square metric
